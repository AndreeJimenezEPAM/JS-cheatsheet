## Module 01:
- #### How to run JS
	1. Command line: with nodejs
	```
	node index.js
	```
	2. From the browser: Create a HTML file that references to JS script.
	```
	<html>
    	<head>
        	<script defer src="./index.js"></script>
    	</head>
	</html>
	```
	3. From the Browser console: ```ctrl+shift+J```
- #### JS syntax
	1. Variable Asignment:
	```
		//Variable asignment
		var x,y,z;
		x = 7; y = y;
		z = x + y;
	```
	2. Literals:
	```
		//Two most important syntax rules for fixed values are
		10.50 //Numbers type can be with decimal
		12938 //Numbers type can be without decimal
		"Strings can be double quote"
		'or can be single quote'
	```
	3. Operators:
	```
		//Asignment operator
		var x = 4 * 5;
		
		//Arithmetic operators "( + - * / )" (just like algebra)
		(5 + 6) * 10
	```
	4. Expresions: an expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
	```
	//Computes (Evaluate) to 50
	5 * 10
	
	//Expressions can also contain variables
	x * 5
	
	//The values can be of various types, numbers and strings
	"John" + " " + "Doe"
	```
